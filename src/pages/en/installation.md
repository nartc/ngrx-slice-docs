Assuming your Angular application is already using NgRx, you can install NgRx Slice with the following command

```bash
npm install ngrx-slice
# or yarn
yarn add ngrx-slice
```

`ngrx-slice` has `ngrx-immer` and `immer` listed as `peerDependencies` so you need to install those as well

```bash
npm install ngrx-immer immer
# or yarn
yarn add ngrx-immer immer
```

Here's one command for all three

```bash
npm install ngrx-slice ngrx-immer immer
# or yarn
yarn add ngrx-slice ngrx-immer immer
```
